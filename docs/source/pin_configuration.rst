Pin Configuration
=================

The 96B Quad Ethernet Mezzanine has both the low-speed and high-speed expansion
connectors as defined by the 96Boards Consumer Edition specification. The following
tables define the pinout of those connectors for this mezzanine card.

Low-speed expansion connector
-----------------------------

Only 9 I/O pins of the low-speed expansion connector are used by the 96B Quad Ethernet
Mezzanine card. The others are directly passed through to the expansion socket on the top
side of the board which can be used for stacking a second mezzanine card.

The 1.8V supply on pin 35 is used by the 96B Quad Ethernet Mezzanine card to detect power-up
of the carrier board, but the mezzanine card does not draw any power from this pin. Instead the
mezzanine card generates it's own +1.8VDC supply using an on-board switching regulator that is
powered by SYS_DCIN (the main supply). The +1.8VDC that is generated on the mezzanine card is
used to power the DP83867 Ethernet PHYs, and is also passed through to the top-side expansion
connector to provide power to a stacked mezzanine if required.

High-speed expansion connector
------------------------------

The high-speed expansion connector routes the SGMII input (Soc-to-PHY) and output (PHY-to-SoC) signals to the development
platform. It also routes the SGMII 625MHz clock (input to SoC), which is generated by the PHY connected to port 3, and is
required by all ports.

Also routed through the high-speed connector are 2 configurable outputs of the DP83867 PHYs called "GPIO0" and "GPIO1". 
These can be used for start-of-packet detection, loss of sync detection, and receive error detection among other things.
Please refer to the datasheet of the DP83867 for more detailed information on these pins and their function.
